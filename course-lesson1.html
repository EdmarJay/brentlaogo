                                Imagine them as the “native tongue” of the computer, the language closest to the
                                hardware itself. Each unique computer has a unique machine language. A machine
                                language program is made up of a series of binary patterns (e.g., 01011100)
                                which represent simple operations that can be accomplished by the computer
                                (e.g., add two operands, move data to a memory location). Machine language
                                programs are executable, meaning that they can be run directly. Programming in
                                machine language requires memorization of the binary codes and can be difficult
                                for the human programmer. A nice and interactive example is present here.

                                They represent an effort to make programming easier for the human. The machine
                                language instructions are replaced with simple pneumonic abbreviations (e.g.,
                                ADD, MOV). Thus assembly languages are unique to a specific computer (machine).
                                Prior to execution, an assembly language program requires translation to machine
                                language. This translation is accomplished by a computer program known as an
                                Assembler. Assemblers are written for each unique machine language.

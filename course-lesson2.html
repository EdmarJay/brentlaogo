                This course covers the use of general purpose programming language to solve problems. The emphasis is to
                train the students to design,
                implement, and test and debug programs intended to solve computing problems using fundamental
                programming constructs.
                This will be introduces to students with no previous programming experience on how to plan and create
                well-structured programs using
                procedural programming paradigms.. </p>

                            those that may have programmed solutions to problems very similar to yours? We learn
                            from the past. Our ancestors discovered and invented ways of programming that we know
                            call paradigms. We benefit from the knowledge they left us, even as we strive to create
                            new paradigms ourselves.<br><br>

                                A programming paradigm is a style, or “way,” of programming.
                                Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others
                                <br>

                            <p style="color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.815);"> Never use the phrase “programming language
                                paradigm.” A paradigm is
                                a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a
                                language). Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a
                                particular programming paradigm P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P
                                language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming language”) but that does
                                not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.</p>

                                One of the more visible aspects of the more pure-ish OO languages is that conditionals
                                and loops become messages themselves, whose arguments are often blocks of executable
                                code. In a Smalltalk-like syntax:</p>

                This course covers the use of general purpose programming language to solve problems. The emphasis is to
                train the students to design,
                implement, and test and debug programs intended to solve computing problems using fundamental
                programming constructs.
                This will be introduces to students with no previous programming experience on how to plan and create
                well-structured programs using
                procedural programming paradigms.. </p>

                            Modern human life is greatly influenced by computers. And the computer is run by a computer
                            program. Computer programs are arranged by programming languages, therefore they are the
                            basis of all the conveniences that we feel. Programming languages are responsible for all
                            programs that have been made; rostering systems, virtual reality, scheduling software,
                            online games, Uber app, anti-virus and so on. Thus mastering programming languages brings
                            one closer to understanding how all digital technology originates. This article will
                            highlight the importance of programming languages.
                            <Br><br>
                            Programming languages ​​refer to different types of expressions and logical structuring
                            rules that serve to generate recurring and systematic tasks. They are of great importance
                            because they allow generating different systems that serve tasks that meet the needs of
                            users. There is a great variety of these languages ​​and in any case they are oriented to
                            different types of requirements; however, this plurality can be divided into two large
                            groups, structured programming languages ​​and object-oriented languages. Almost everything
                            we can use in computer science is largely due to programming languages.
                            <Br><br>
                            A computer allows calculation operations at high speed; However, it is totally unusable if
                            it were not for the programs that run on it. These programs are of various kinds, with the
                            operating system perhaps the most important of all, the system on which the different
                            applications run. Programming languages ​​are always necessary for their development, each
                            of which has specific characteristics for its implementation. In addition, each programming
                            language is written in turn with a lower level, allowing a plurality of responses to
                            existing needs. In other words, each program is made in a clear flow; simple solutions are
                            followed by more complex solutions, and so on, following the path that is adapted to the
                            evolving needs. It is worth remembering that every discipline comes from a simple
                            understanding, so does the science of programming languages.
                            <Br><br>
                            As we have said, there are two large groups of programming languages, those with structured
                            programming and those that are object oriented. In the first case the language consists of a
                            set of instructions and orders as well as a set of rules of application thereof;
                            propositional logic plays a fundamental role in this case and all operations can be subject
                            to logical relationships. In the case of an object-oriented programming language, on the
                            other hand, there is an intention to reflect in the language different circumstances of real
                            existence; thus, reference will be made to objects, classes, inheritances, attributes, etc.
                            Programming languages ​​can also be divided between interpreted languages ​​and compiled
                            languages; in the first case the language must be interpreted by another program, while in
                            the second case it must be translated by means of a compiler, creating in the process a file
                            that is called executable.
                            <Br><br>
                            The knowledge of some programming language can be very important to develop capacities in
                            terms of problem solving and task automation. Certainly this type of knowledge coupled with
                            some basic notions of algorithms can open a whole new panorama of job possibilities.

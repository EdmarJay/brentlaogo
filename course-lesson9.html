                This course covers the use of general purpose programming language to solve problems. The emphasis is to
                train the students to design,
                implement, and test and debug programs intended to solve computing problems using fundamental
                programming constructs.
                This will be introduces to students with no previous programming experience on how to plan and create

                                The iteration (for, while, and do-while loop) statements allows a set of instruction to
                                be performed repeatedly until a certain condition is fulfilled. The iteration statements
                                are also called loops or looping statements. C++ provides three kinds of loops :<br><br>

                                • for loop<br>
                                • while loop<br>
                                • do-while loop
                                <br><br>

                                All three loop constructs of C++ repeat a set of statements as long as a specified
                                condition remains true. This specified condition is generally referred to as a loop
                                control. For all three loop statements, a true condition is any nonzero value. A zero
                                value indicates a false condition.<br><br>
                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Loop parts</h2>
                                <p>Every loops has its elements that control and govern its execution. Generally, a loop
                                    has four elements that have different purposes. These elements are as :<br><br>
                                    • iInitialization Expression(s)<br>
                                    • Test Expression<br>
                                    • Update Expression(s)<br>
                                    • Loop's Body<br><Br>
                                    Let's discuss these parts of a loop one by one
                                </p><br>

                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Initialization Expression(s)
                                </h2>
                                <p>Before entering in a loop, its control variable(s) must be initialized. The
                                    initialization of the control variable(s) takes place under initialization
                                    expression(s). The initialization expression(s) give(s) the loop variable(s) their
                                    first value(s). The initialization expression(s) is executed only once, in the
                                    beginning of the loop.</p><br>

                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Test Expression</h2>
                                <p>The test expression is an expression whose truth value decides whether the loop-body
                                    will be executed or not. If the test expression evaluates to true i.e., 1, the
                                    loop-body gets executed, otherwise the loop is terminated.</p>
                                <p>In an entry-controlled loop, the test-expression is evaluated before exiting from the
                                    loop. In C++, the for loop and while loop are entry-controlled loops and do-while
                                    loop is exit-controlled loop.</p><br>

                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Update Expression(s)</h2>
                                <p>The update expression(s) change the value(s) of loop variable(s). The update
                                    expression(s) is executed; at the end of the loop after the loop-body is executed.
                                </p><br>

                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Loop's Body</h2>
                                <p>The statements that are executed repeatedly (as long as the test-expression is
                                    nonzero) from the body of the loop. In an entry-controlled loop, first
                                    test-expression is evaluated and if it is nonzero, the body-of-the-loop is executed;
                                    if the test-expression evaluates to be zero, the loop is terminated. In an
                                    exit-controlled loop, the body-of-the-loop is executed first and then the
                                    test-expression is evaluated. If it evaluates to be zero, the loop is terminated
                                    otherwise repeated. Now let's discuss the C++ loops: for, while and do-while.</p>

                                <p>The for loop is the easiest to understand of the C++ loops. All its loop-control
                                    elements are gathered in one place (on the top of the loop), while in the other loop

                                <p>The following lines explain the working of the above given for loop program :
                                    <br><br>

                                    • Firstly, initialization expression is executed, i.e., i=1 which gives the first
                                    value 1 to variable i.<br>
                                    • Then, the test expression is evaluated i.e., i <= 10 which results into true i.e.,
                                        1.<br>
                                        • Since, the test expression is true, the body-of-the-loop i.e., cout << i
                                            << " " ; is executed which prints the current value of i then a single
                                            space.<br>
                                            • After executing the loop-body, the update expression i.e., i++ is executed
                                            which
                                            increments the value of i. (After first execution of the loop, the value of
                                            i becomes
                                            2 after the execution of i++, since initially i was 1).<br>
                                            • AFter the update expression is executed, the test-expression is again
                                            evaluated. If it is true the sequence is repeated from the step no 3,
                                            otherwise the loop terminates.<br><Br>

                                <p>If a loop does not contain any statement in its loop-body, it is said to be an empty
                                    loop. In such cases, a C++ loop contains an empty statement i.e., a null statement.
                                    Following for loop is an empty loop:</p>

                                <p>See, the body of the above for loop contains just (a null statement). It is an empty
                                    loop. An empty for loop has its applications in pointer manipulations where you need
                                    to increment or decrement pointer position without doing anything else.<br><br>

                                    Time delay loops are often used in programs. The following code shows how to create

                                    then it is not part of for loop. For example, consider the following :</p>

while(expression)

                                    statement. The loop iterates while the expression evaluates to true. When the
                                    expression becomes false, the program control passes to the line after the loop-body
                                    code.<br><br>

                                    In a while loop, a loop control variable should be initialized before the loop
                                    begins as an uninitialized variable can be used in the expression. The loop variable
                                    should be updated inside the body-of-the-while.

                                <p>Unlike the for and while loops, the do-while is an exit-controlled loop i.e., it
                                    evaluates its test-expression at the bottom of the loop after executing its
                                    loop-body statements. This means that a do-while loop always executes at least once.

                                    In the other two loops for and while, the test-expression is evaluated at the
                                    beginning of the loop i.e., before executing the loop-body. If the test-expression
                                    evaluates to false for the first time itself, the loop is never executed. But in
                                    some situations, it is wanted that the loop-body is executed at least once, no
                                    matter what the initial state of the test-expression is. In such cases, the do-while
                                    loop is the obvious choice.<br>

                This course covers the use of general purpose programming language to solve problems. The emphasis is to
                train the students to design,
                implement, and test and debug programs intended to solve computing problems using fundamental
                programming constructs.
                This will be introduces to students with no previous programming experience on how to plan and create
                well-structured programs using
                procedural programming paradigms.. </p>

                                When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that
                                communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a
                                class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.
                            </p><br>

                        </p>
                        <p> <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">Class -</b> Objects have states and behaviors.
                            Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking,
                            eating. An object is an instance of a class.<br>
                            <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">Objects -</b> A class can be defined as a
                            template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.<br>
                            <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">Methods - </b> A method is basically a behavior. A
                            class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is
                            manipulated and all the actions are executed.<br>
                            <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">Instance Varialbes -</b> Each object has its
                            unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to
                            these instance variables.<br>

                        <p>Let us look at the various parts of the above program −<br><br>
                            • The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either
                            necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header < iostream> is
                                needed.<br>
                                • The line using <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">namespace std;</b> tells the
                                compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces
                                are a relatively recent addition to C++.<br>
                                • The next line <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">'// main() is where program
                                    execution begins.'</b> is a single-line comment
                                available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the
                                line.<br>
                                • The line <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">int main()</b> is the main function
                                where program execution begins.<br>
                                • The next line <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">cout << "Hello World" ;</b>
                                        causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.<br>
                                        • The next line <b style="color:rgba(81, 255, 0, 0.979);">return 0;</b>
                                        terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling
                                        process. <br>

                        <p>In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be
                            ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.

                        <p>A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other
                            user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_)
                            followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).<br><br>

                            C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a
                            case-sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two
                            different
